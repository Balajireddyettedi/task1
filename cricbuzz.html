<h2>History</h2>
<pre><p>Cricbuzz was created by Pankaj Chhaparwal, Piyush Agrawal, and Pravin Hegde in 2004.[7] In 2010, Cricbuzz started developing a mobile app for live cricket news and scores.

In November 2014, Times Internet, a subsidiary of Times of India acquired a majority stake in Cricbuzz for an undisclosed sum. The website continues to be managed by the original founders.[7][8]

In January 2015, Times Internet-owned GoCricket was merged into Cricbuzz. GoCricket's website was redirected to Cricbuzz and the GoCricket mobile app was also merged with that of Cricbuzz.[8] Cricbuzz hired Harsha Bhogle as ‘Voice of Cricket’ in September 2016 and has produced over 150 videos with the esteemed commentator and cricket expert ever since.[9]

In August 2015, Cricbuzz was named the title sponsor of the India-Sri Lanka test series.[10][11]

Cricbuzz was reported to be the second most downloaded news app in the world for the second quarter of 2019.
